## Repository Organization

The project code is located in the `src` directory. For each section,
there is a corresponding code file named using its section number.
For example, the code for section 1 is in the file `part1.py`.

In the `sections` directory, you can find the different latex files
belonging to the different sections included in the `report.tex` file.

## Makefile
The `make` command generates the report, and to get details on the report compilation,
`make verbose` has to be run.
