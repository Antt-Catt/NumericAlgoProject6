## Repository Organization

The project code is located in the `src` directory. For each section,
there is a corresponding code file named using its section number.
For example, the code for section 1 is in the file `part1.py`.
The directory also contains various test files belonging to the different
sections. For example, the tests for section 1 are in the file `test1.py`.

In the `sections` directory, you can find the different latex files
belonging to the different sections included in the `report.tex` file.

## Makefile

The Makefile has several targets. By running the `make test` command,
you can run tests on all sections. The `make` command generates the report,
and to get details on the report compilation, one needs to run the
`make verbose` command.
